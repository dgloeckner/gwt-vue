# vuecomponent

This module contains an exemplary Vue component which can be developed standalone using modern tooling
and fast build cycles.

GWT integration is achieved by piping `parent.html` for the
 GWT module through `webpack`.

For standalone vue.js development please see `vuecomponent-dev` module.

Integrated build is triggered from `build-vue-and-gwt.sh`.
